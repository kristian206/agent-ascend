# Security Audit Report - Agency Max Plus Platform
**Date:** August 30, 2024  
**Auditor:** System Security Review  
**Platform:** Agency Max Plus - Performance Gamification Platform

## Executive Summary
This security audit reveals several critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. While Firebase provides some built-in security features, the implementation has significant gaps that could lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.

## üî¥ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

### 1. **Hardcoded API Keys in Source Code**
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** `/lib/firebase.js`  
**Issue:** Firebase configuration including API keys are hardcoded directly in the source code
```javascript
apiKey: "AIzaSyAhmDjn32Rhm4Sujd3dZusLISaATXo_4Vc"
```
**Risk:** These credentials are exposed in the client-side bundle and visible to anyone
**Recommendation:** 
- Move sensitive keys to server-side environment variables
- Use Firebase security rules to restrict access
- Implement API key restrictions in Firebase Console

### 2. **No Firestore Security Rules**
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Issue:** No evidence of Firestore security rules implementation
**Risk:** Any authenticated user could potentially read/write any document
**Recommendation:** Implement strict Firestore security rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    // Only team members can read team data
    match /teams/{teamId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid in resource.data.members;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. **Weak Password Requirements**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `/app/page.js` line 152  
**Issue:** Minimum password length is only 6 characters
**Risk:** Vulnerable to brute force attacks
**Recommendation:** 
- Increase minimum length to 12 characters
- Require uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Implement password strength meter
- Add password breach checking (Have I Been Pwned API)

## üü° HIGH RISK ISSUES

### 4. **No CSRF Protection**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Issue:** No CSRF tokens implemented for state-changing operations
**Risk:** Cross-site request forgery attacks possible
**Recommendation:** 
- Implement CSRF tokens for all POST/PUT/DELETE requests
- Use SameSite cookie attributes
- Verify referrer headers

### 5. **Client-Side Role Management**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `/components/AuthProvider.js` line 47  
**Issue:** "god" role is assigned client-side based on email
```javascript
role: user.email === 'kristian.suson@gmail.com' ? 'god' : 'member'
```
**Risk:** Can be bypassed by modifying client code
**Recommendation:** 
- Move role assignment to server-side Cloud Functions
- Store roles in custom claims on Firebase Auth tokens
- Validate roles server-side

### 6. **No Rate Limiting**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Issue:** No rate limiting on authentication attempts
**Risk:** Brute force attacks on user accounts
**Recommendation:** 
- Implement rate limiting on login attempts
- Add CAPTCHA after failed attempts
- Temporary account lockouts

## üü† MEDIUM RISK ISSUES

### 7. **Session Management**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Issue:** No session timeout or renewal mechanism
**Risk:** Sessions persist indefinitely
**Recommendation:** 
- Implement session timeout (30 minutes of inactivity)
- Add "Remember Me" functionality properly
- Force re-authentication for sensitive operations

### 8. **Unvalidated Redirects**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** Multiple locations using `router.push()`
**Risk:** Open redirect vulnerabilities
**Recommendation:** 
- Validate all redirect URLs
- Use whitelist of allowed redirect destinations

### 9. **Information Disclosure**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** Error messages throughout
**Issue:** Detailed error messages reveal system information
**Risk:** Aids attackers in reconnaissance
**Recommendation:** 
- Generic error messages for users
- Log detailed errors server-side only

## üü¢ LOW RISK ISSUES

### 10. **Missing Security Headers**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Issue:** No security headers configured
**Recommendation:** Add headers:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security

### 11. **No Input Sanitization for XSS**
**Severity:** LOW (React provides some protection)  
**Issue:** User inputs not explicitly sanitized
**Recommendation:** 
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use DOMPurify for any HTML content
- Validate input types and lengths

## ‚úÖ POSITIVE FINDINGS

1. **No SQL Injection Risk** - Using Firestore (NoSQL)
2. **No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** - Good React security practice
3. **HTTPS Enforced** - Via Firebase hosting
4. **Password Hashing** - Handled by Firebase Auth
5. **.env.local Used** - Environment variables not committed

## üìã IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1 (Do Today):
1. **Remove hardcoded Firebase config from source code**
2. **Implement Firestore security rules**
3. **Move "god" role assignment to server-side**

### Priority 2 (This Week):
1. **Strengthen password requirements**
2. **Add rate limiting to authentication**
3. **Implement CSRF protection**

### Priority 3 (This Month):
1. **Add security headers**
2. **Implement session timeouts**
3. **Add input validation and sanitization**
4. **Set up security monitoring and alerts**

## üõ°Ô∏è RECOMMENDED SECURITY STACK

1. **Authentication:** Firebase Auth with custom claims
2. **Authorization:** Firestore security rules + Cloud Functions
3. **Rate Limiting:** Cloud Armor or custom middleware
4. **Monitoring:** Firebase Analytics + Cloud Logging
5. **Secrets Management:** Google Secret Manager
6. **WAF:** Cloudflare or Cloud Armor

## üìä RISK ASSESSMENT

**Overall Security Score:** 3/10 (High Risk)

**Data Breach Likelihood:** HIGH without immediate remediation

**Compliance Issues:**
- Not GDPR compliant (no proper data protection)
- Not PCI DSS compliant (if handling payments)
- Not SOC 2 compliant

## üîê ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Security Testing:**
   - Implement automated security scanning
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Security code reviews

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Set up intrusion detection
   - Monitor for suspicious activities
   - Implement audit logging

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Create incident response plan
   - Set up automated alerts
   - Regular security drills

4. **User Security:**
   - Add two-factor authentication
   - Implement device fingerprinting
   - Add login notifications

## Conclusion

The Agency Max Plus platform currently has **CRITICAL security vulnerabilities** that need immediate attention. The most pressing issues are the exposed API keys and lack of proper authorization rules. These vulnerabilities could lead to complete system compromise.

**Recommendation:** Pause new feature development and focus on security remediation immediately.
