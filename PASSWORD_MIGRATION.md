### 2. üéØ User Experience Flow

#### For Existing Users:
1. Login with current password (6+ characters)
2. See security banner on dashboard
3. Optional: Update password immediately or dismiss for later
4. Can update anytime from profile settings

#### For New Users:
1. Must create password with new requirements
2. 12+ characters minimum
3. Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
4. Real-time strength indicator

### 3. üìã Security Requirements

#### New Password Standards:
- ‚úÖ Minimum 12 characters
- ‚úÖ At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- ‚úÖ At least one lowercase letter (a-z)

## Implementation Details

### Components Created:

#### 1. `PasswordMigration.js`
- Security banner with dismissible notification
- Modal for password update
- Real-time password strength indicator
- Validation feedback
- Success notifications

#### 2. `SecurityNotification.js`
- Toast-style notifications
- Auto-dismiss for success messages
- Security feature highlights
- Progress indicator

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `app/page.js` (Login Page)
```javascript
// Lenient validation for login (existing users)
else if (mode === 'login') {
  if (value.length < 6) {
    error = 'Password must be at least 6 characters'
  }
}

// Strict validation for signup (new users)
else if (mode === 'signup') {
  // Full validation with 12+ chars and complexity
}
```

#### 2. `app/dashboard/page.js`
```javascript
// Added PasswordMigration component
<PasswordMigration 
  user={user} 
  onComplete={() => console.log('Updated')}
  onDismiss={() => console.log('Dismissed')}
/>
```

### Database Schema:

#### User Document Fields:
```javascript
{
  passwordMigrated: boolean,        // Has user updated password?
  passwordMigratedAt: timestamp,     // When was it updated?
  lastPasswordChange: timestamp      // Track password age
}
```

## User Interface

## Security Benefits

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Protection:
1. **Stronger Passwords:** 12+ characters exponentially harder to crack
2. **Complexity Requirements:** Prevents dictionary attacks
3. **Graceful Migration:** No forced password resets
4. **User Education:** Clear communication about security improvements

### üìä Migration Metrics:
Track in Firestore:
- Users with migrated passwords
- Migration completion rate
- Time to migration
- Dismissal rate

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Current)
- Migration available but optional
- Banner can be dismissed
- No enforcement deadline

### Phase 2: Encouragement (Future)
- More prominent reminders
- Incentives for updating (bonus points?)
- Email reminders for non-migrated users

### Phase 3: Enforcement (Future)
- Set deadline for migration
- Require update on next login after deadline
- Provide support for users needing help

## Support Documentation

### For Users:
- Clear explanation of why update is needed
- Step-by-step update guide
- FAQ about new requirements
- Contact support option

### For Admins:
- Migration progress dashboard
- User list with migration status
- Bulk reminder capabilities
- Override options for special cases

## Code Examples

### Check Migration Status:
```javascript
const checkMigrationStatus = async (userId) => {
  const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, 'users', userId))
  return userDoc.data()?.passwordMigrated || false
}
```

### Update Password with Migration:
```javascript
const migratePassword = async (user, newPassword) => {
  await updatePassword(user, newPassword)
  await updateDoc(doc(db, 'users', user.uid), {
    passwordMigrated: true,
    passwordMigratedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    lastPasswordChange: new Date().toISOString()
  })
}
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics:
- Migration completion rate
- Average time to migrate
- Support tickets related to passwords
- Failed update attempts

### Alerts:
- High failure rate on updates
- Users stuck in migration flow
- Repeated dismissals without updating
